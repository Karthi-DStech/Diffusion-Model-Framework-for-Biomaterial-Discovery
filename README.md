# Denoising-Diffusion-Probablistic-Models-for-Biomaterial-Discovery

**Diffusion Model Training for Image Generation using Biomaterial Topography Dataset**

This project contains the code to train a diffusion model for Biomaterial Discovery. It includes a PyTorch implementation of the U-Net model, several building blocks used in the model architecture, and scripts for training and logging.

**The Generated images can be found in the `Generated Image/` folder. Currently, this repo holds the DDPM-generated images of 32X32 and 64X64 pixel resolution topographies.**
